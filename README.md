# Set-up
This is a minimal project that starts Cypress and should go in a compliment to (nx-invalid-cypress-config)[https://github.com/joshdales/nx-invalid-cypress-config], and shows it working with `"type": "module"` in package.json.

1. `npm install`
2. Start the dev server `npm run dev`
3. Start Cypress E2E test `npm run test`
